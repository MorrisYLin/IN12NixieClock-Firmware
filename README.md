# IN12NixieClock-Firmware

Please see [this repo](https://github.com/MorrisYLin/IN12NixieClock-Hardware) for the design files and images of the PCB's physical design.

## Overview
This code is written for the EK-TM4C1294XL Development Board from TI, one of the boards used in ECE 445L Embedded Systems Design Laboratory at UT Austin's ECE Department. This project, however, is fully personal and separate from the class.
